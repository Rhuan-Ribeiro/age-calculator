# Age Calculator (Vite + JavaScript + Luxon)

An age calculator built with **Vite**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
This project was created as part of a [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) exercise to practice how to use **external packages via NPM**.

Users can enter their date of birth using the **JavaScript Datepicker**, and the app calculates and displays their exact age in **years, months, and days**, using the **Luxon** library for precise date handling.
